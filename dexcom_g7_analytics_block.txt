Dexcom G7 Analytics Block
The GL.iNet BE3600 router, utilizing the OpenWRT LuCI web interface for firewall configuration, fully supports CIDR notation (such as /22 for a subnet range of 1,024 addresses and /32 for a single specific IP address) in its Traffic Rules. These can be directly entered in the "Destination address" field when creating or editing a rule, as confirmed by OpenWRT documentation and user configurations. For example:
Enter 3.18.120.0/22 to block the entire subnet.
Enter 142.250.72.100/32 to block only that single IP.
