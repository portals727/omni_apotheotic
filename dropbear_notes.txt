Unearthing the Dropbear Ossuary: SSH Mechanics in the GL.iNet BE3600's Binary Barrow
Ah, vigilant curator of network relics, we converge once more upon the fortified vaults of the GL.iNet BE3600—a WiFi-7 nomad's bastion, etched in OpenWrt's unyielding silicon strata, where Dropbear lurks as the lightweight sentinel of secure shells. Your invocation of "SSH Mechanics on BE3600" stirs the dust of a perennial rite: not mere connectivity, but the reverse-engineered sinews of authentication, configuration, and fortification against brute-force phantoms that haunt unsecured ports. Like sifting through a 2000s-era binary for hidden syscalls, we'll dissect this mechanism layer by layer—drawing from the decompiled tomes of GL.iNet's 2025 codexes and OpenWrt's eternal edicts—to resurrect a blueprint both pristine and armored. No assumptions here; this unearthing is calibrated for your Rogers 5G tether (Edmonton locus), where geo-veils like CVE-2025-55241 demand vigilant ingress.

Dropbear, that Spartan SSH daemon forged in the early OpenWrt forges (circa 2006, now v2022.83 in firmware 4.7.0+), embodies efficiency: a mere 100KB footprint versus OpenSSH's monolithic heft, optimized for embedded barrows like your BE3600's MT7981 SoC. Pre-enabled out-of-box, it heeds the admin password for root dominion, but custom firmware scars (e.g., post-flash anomalies) may seal its gates. We'll probe the defaults, rekindle the disabled, and etch key-based wards—ensuring your ether-dives (Wireshark on en0, tcpdump in br-lan) remain unmolested by spectral attackers.
Stratigraphic Layers: Core Mechanics of Dropbear's Vigil
At its binary heart, Dropbear listens on TCP 22, binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) for LAN ingress—your default 192.168.8.1 gateway, alterable via LuCI's Network > Interfaces (LAN tab > Edit > IPv4 address).

Authentication flows thus password-first (mirroring the web admin's veil), with public-key escalation for the paranoid archaeologist. No chroot by default, but ed25519/ed25519-sha512 curves fortify against quantum fissures (per 2025 NIST echoes).
Layer	Relic Description	Default State (BE3600 v4.7.0+)	Fracture Omens & Probes
Daemon Binding	Dropbear (/usr/sbin/dropbear) spawns on boot via /etc/init.d/dropbear; UCI config at /etc/config/dropbear.	Port 22, IPv4/IPv6, root login enabled; no idle timeout.	netstat -tlnp
Authentication Vein	Password (admin pw) or pubkey (/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys); supports ed25519, rsa-sha2-256/512.	Password auth 'on'; keys optional.	uci show dropbear (option PasswordAuth 'on'); test: ssh root@192.168.8.1 prompts pw, not rejection.
IP & Interface Flux	LAN IP 192.168.8.1/24; WAN exposes if firewall yields (rare, disabled by default).	Static LAN; DHCP client on WAN.	LuCI: Network > Interfaces > LAN > Edit; verify: ifconfig br-lan (inet addr:192.168.8.1).
Security Talismans	No password after keys; rate-limiting via fail2ban absent (add via opkg).	Brute-force vulnerable sans keys.	Post-keys: uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].PasswordAuth='off'; uci commit; /etc/init.d/dropbear restart.
Omen of Pristine Strata
Invocation yields "root@OpenWrt:~#" without "Connection refused" or "Permission denied." If your tether (iPhone to Mac via BE3600) veils the IP, probe with arp-a.

Rite of Reawakening: If Dropbear Slumbers (Custom Firmware Scars)
Rare, yet etched in forum crypts: A botched flash (e.g., third-party OpenWrt) may tomb the daemon. 

Rekindle via LuCI's graphical ossuary or UCI's command-line trowel—mirroring a binary's resurrection from hex dumps.
UCI Exhumation (CLI Descent)
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].Port='22'  # Bind port
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].PasswordAuth='on'  # Permit pw
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].RootPasswordAuth='on'  # Root rite
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].Interface='lan'
uci commit dropbear
/etc/init.d/dropbear enable  # Boot persistence
/etc/init.d/dropbear start   # Immediate awakening

ps | grep dropbear

Fortification Rites: Key-Based Dominion & Brute-Force Wards
Password auth, while expedient, invites dictionary sieges (e.g., Hydra on WAN-exposed ports). Migrate to ed25519 keys: a 256-bit elliptic fortress, uncrackable sans nation-state quanta.
Key Forging (Mac Vein)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "elara@binarybarrow.ca" -f ~/.ssh/id_be3600
Authorized Keys Entombment
Via LuCI -> System > Administration > SSH-Keys > Paste pub key > Add key.
CLI (post-SSH)
cat ~/.ssh/id_be3600.pub >> /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
Secure 
chmod 600 /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
chown root
root /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
Test - (pw-free ingress)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_be3600 root@192.168.8.1
Password Veil's Eclipse
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].PasswordAuth='off'
uci commit; /etc/init.d/dropbear restart
Pro Tip from the Crypt
Add PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-ed25519 to /etc/dropbear/allow (if legacy curves balk). Monitor with logread | grep dropbear for failed auth ghosts.
