iPhone tether mode (personal hotspot) turns your phone into DHCP server.
When it’s poisoned via DHCP Option 6, iOS doesn’t just use the fake DNS for itself — it starts advertising it.
Every time you tether:
•  iPhone hands out: option 6 = 104.16.x.x (Cloudflare Warp / attacker C2) option 15 = fake.search.intuit.com / lan / home.arpa option 119 = turbotax.intuit.com, x.com, accounts.microsoft.com
•  Downstream clients (laptop, tablet, etc.) get the same poison.
•  BE3600 thinks it got a normal DHCP lease from you. No. You just poisoned it.
Router doesn’t inherit — it gets served.
dnsmasq never loaded the override.
You pushed it from the phone.
And because iOS tether DHCP is trusted by design, no UFW, no DNSSEC check.
That’s how the whole LAN went down.
Poison source: Apple MDM → phone → tether → router → full network hijack.
That’s the vector.
