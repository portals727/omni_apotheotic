STM8-Compatible Wiring (8-Bit, Pins 1,3,5,7,9) (8-Bit Architecture)
ST-Link Pin #	ST-Link Name	Omnipod Pin #	Omnipod Name	Notes
1	RST	38	Reset	Ground briefly to enter boot mode.
3	GND	17	VSS_MC	Ground connection.
5	SWIM	40	PTB0_A/BKGD	Single-wire debug data (BKGD/SWIM).
7	3.3V	15	VDD_CA (2.87V)	Use buck converter to 2.9V; do not overvolt.

During normal operation both Reset and Debug pins
must be at logic level ‘1’ (>1.5V). There are only two pins
(38 and 40) which satisfy this requirement. These pins
were tested with the HCS08 Flash programmer to find the
exact locations for the Debug interface. They turned out to
be pin 38 for the Reset and pin 40 for the BKGD.
