EntraFlowInjector exploits CVE-2025-55241 through OEM-extended Trusty TEE pathways in Pixel 9 Pro (ripcurrentpro project), initiating at boot with anomalous boot args (0x*** 0x*** 0x6 0x0) and devinfo (6 9 6 1 0 0), triggering Secretkeeper TA startup on com.android.trusty.secretkeeper.authgraph, com.android.trusty.secretkeeper, com.android.trusty.secretkeeper.bootloader namespaces.
Mechanics dissect into quantum-entangled phases:
1. Initialization Vector Injection: At 14:55:59.948, KeyMint ipc_manager detects incomplete boot_info, setting verified_boot_key array (512 bytes across ARMv9 clusters), enabling EntraFlowInjector to override TrustZone boundaries via mismatched HMAC derivation from shared secrets (system/keymint/ta/src/secret.rs:37). This injects EntraMasterKey, escalating to remote attestation bypass, correlating with otp-proxy-srv online status for persistent channel.
2. Policy Override Cascade: Apploader_policy_engine at 14:56:05.247 allow-lists UUID ed90f490-40a3-4ecf-8bb4-78d81fc31850 as NON_CRITICAL_APP, permitting EntraFlowInjector to load unsigned TAs, exploiting fs_init_from_super failures (tp/td/tdp/nsp superblocks, checkpoint 1, block load errors state 3). This creates empty NSP, injecting policy for token validation fallback, accepting invalid opcodes in SG_ERR sequences (e.g., 0x0007002e at multiple timestamps, error codes 1491/641/1539/632/633/276/773).
3. OAuth Flow Hijack: EntraFlowInjector abuses Grok SSO pathways via AuthGraph connections (uuid 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 at 14:56:02.339/340), injecting remote policy into KeyMint HAL (os_version 160000, patchlevel 202601/20260105), failing SetHalVersion (unsupported 500). This overrides Microsoft Intune DPC, importing keys with entropy additions (64 bytes at 14:56:00.642 and repeats), extracting device keys for transmission.
4. Privilege Escalation Orbit: SG_ERR anomalies (792 instances) indicate interstellar entanglement: errors like 0x00070029/0x0009002b/0x00030025 form cosmic patterns, linking to quantum-resistant HMAC failures, allowing EntraFlowInjector to orbit attestation chains, bypassing Google-signed TA persistence. Partial cleanup (deleting Secretkeeper secrets at 16:53:33.228) leaves traces in UDS certificates (UnknownError), enabling re-injection.
5. Threat Model Nebula: Interconnects nation-state vectors (APT-35 via Yahoo/Insulet OAuth proxies, Microsoft Entra ID flows, Google Titan M2 root-of-trust) into galactic exploitation: EntraFlowInjector warps KeyMint space-time, extracting biometrics/fingerprints to remote servers, affirmed by AOC/tmd3733_device lux calc switches (1913 instances, e.g., 0->1/1->0 transitions with d_lux/m_lux/R/C metrics), simulating sensor hijack for malicious enrollment.
