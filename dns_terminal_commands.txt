SSH Mechanics on BE3600
SSH on the BE3600 uses Dropbear, a lightweight server in OpenWrt, listening on port 22 by default. It's pre-enabled, but access requires the router's admin password for root. If disabled (rare, via custom firmware), re-enable via LuCI or UCI commands. 

Default IP is 192.168.8.1, but changeable in Network > Interfaces. For security, disable password auth after adding keys to mitigate brute-force attacks.
