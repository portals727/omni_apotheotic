Advanced Criminal Indictment Outline: Cross-Border Assassination Network Targeting Canadian Citizen  

To Google Security Team,

Ongoing targeted assassination attempts using Apple GSPE-21 MDM infrastructure have compromised multiple Google accounts associated with my identity.

The attackers (linked to IRGC fronts and U.S. pharma tenants) exploit federated Entra ID + Google SSO to push silent device policies, DNS poisoning, and credential hijacking.

Specific incidents:

Multiple Google accounts locked/revoked tokens after MDM enrollment detection.

DNS redirects through Google Cloud edges (AS15169) observed concurrently with GSPE handshakes.

Family Link abuse registered adult account as supervised child, granting full device control.

All attempts correlate with access to Google services (Gmail, Drive, Play Store) signed in on affected devices.

This is not isolated hacking — it is state-sponsored terrorism using Google's federation and app infrastructure as persistence vectors.

Request immediate:

Full audit of all Entra/Google SSO tokens tied to my accounts. Revocation of any conditional-access policies affecting my devices.

Disclosure of any third-party tenant access to my account data.

Evidence (logs, biome dumps, tenant IDs) available upon request.

This is active exploitation under 18 USC § 2331 (domestic terrorism) and related statutes.
State-sponsored actors (IRGC-linked fronts, in coordination with Apple, Insulet, H&R Block, and Intuit) are actively exploiting Microsoft Entra ID federation to compromise my Google accounts and devices.
____
Vectors:
CVE-2025-55241 chained with legacy Yahoo OAuth delegations to Gmail, creating permanent cross-ecosystem access even after Yahoo deletion.

GSPE-21 (Apple) silent MDM payloads delivered via enterprise tenants originally issued to Insulet, H&R Block, and Intuit.

DNS poisoning recurs every 4–12 hours via Entra conditional-access, consuming 45+ minutes daily to mitigate.

Impacts:
portals781@gmail.com and portals371@gmail.com locked out of security features, settings, and deletion ("This change isn't allowed by your admin").

Token revocation and session hijacking on network change.

Opera Mobile Browser shows managed restrictions on fresh installs tied to these accounts.

This is material support to terrorism (18 USC § 2339A/B), computer fraud (18 USC § 1030), and conspiracy to commit murder via medical-device weaponization.

Request:
Audit and revoke all Entra-federated tokens/delegations for my accounts.
Forced recovery/deletion access for listed Gmails.
Disclosure of third-party tenant access.
Logs, payload binaries, tenant IDs available.
Terminate this threat immediately.
____
Primary State and Corporate Actors
- Apple Inc. (U.S. – Cupertino, CA) – Architect and operator of GSPE-21 silent payload channel; direct third-attempt execution.
- Insulet Corporation (U.S. – Acton, MA) – Original tenant owner (9c7a4b); first and second attempts via OmniPod killware.
- Microsoft Corporation (U.S. – Redmond, WA) – Entra ID federation backbone enabling persistent token hijack and conditional-access poison.
- H&R Block Inc. (U.S. – Kansas City, MO) – Root enterprise certificate provider; sub-leased keys to malicious tenants.
- Intuit Inc. (TurboTax/QuickBooks) (U.S. – Mountain View, CA) – Secondary tenant chain; DNS poison relay via shared Entra infrastructure.
- IRGC Front Companies (Iran – various Dubai/UAE shells) – End-user exploiters; direct beneficiaries of leased keys for targeted killings.
____
**Ongoing Harm Pattern**:
- DNS poisoning recurs every 4–12 hours via Entra conditional-access + Rogers tether lease renewal.
- Each incident requires 45 minutes manual intervention (reset tether, flush DNS, reboot device) — deliberate harassment and denial of service.
- Cumulative effect: daily disruption of communications, banking, medical management — amounting to psychological torture and endangerment.

This network constitutes a state-sponsored/corporate hybrid assassination apparatus operating on Canadian soil against a Canadian citizen. Extradition, sanctions, and seizure of assets warranted immediately.
