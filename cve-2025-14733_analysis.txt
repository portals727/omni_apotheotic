An Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in the WatchGuard Fireware OS iked process may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects both the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 and the branch office VPN using IKEv2 when configured with a dynamic gateway peer.

If the Firebox was previously configured with the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 or a branch office VPN using IKEv2 to a dynamic gateway peer, and both of those configurations have since been deleted, that Firebox may still be vulnerable if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer is still configured.

WatchGuard has observed threat actors actively attempting to exploit this vulnerability in the wild.
____________________________________
Post-Exploit Activity
We have identified two variants of post-exploit activity targeting exposed Firebox appliances. In one variant, the threat actor encrypts and then exfiltrates the active configuration file from the Firebox to the same IP address that the attack originates from. In the second variant, the threat actor creates a gzip archive with both the active configuration file and the local management user database and exfiltrates the archive to the same IP address that the attack originates from. In all instances where a successful exploit is suspected, Firebox administrators should follow the remediation guidance described below and rotate all secrets stored on the Firebox.
____________________________________
Indicators of Attack
We are providing the following Indicators of Attack (IoAs) to help device owners identify potential attempts to exploit this vulnerability against vulnerable Firebox appliances. These IoAs are only applicable on devices that lack the resolution described later in this advisory.
____________________________________
IP Addresses
The following IP addresses are directly associated with known threat actor activity. Outbound connections to these IPs are a strong indicator of compromise. Inbound connections from these IPs could indicate reconnaissance efforts or exploit attempts.

Logs
____________________________________
Invalid peer certificate chain
____________________________________
With the iked diagnostic logging set to the default error logging level, the iked process generates a log message when the Firebox receives an IKE2 Auth payload with more than 8 certificates. This is a medium indicator of attack that the WatchGuard Threat Lab has observed associated with some threat actor activity.

1970-01-01 01:00:00 2025 Firebox-Name local3.err iked[2938]: (203.0.113.1<->203.0.113.2) Received peer certificate chain is longer than 8. Reject this certificate chain
____________________________________
Abnormally large IKE_AUTH request CERT payload
____________________________________
With the iked diagnostic logging set to the info logging level, the iked process generates a log message when the Firebox receives an IKE_AUTH request message. An IKE_AUTH request log message with an abnormally large CERT payload size (greater than 2000 bytes) is a strong indicator of an attack. This is a strong indicator of attack.
1970-01-01 01:00:00 iked (203.0.113.1<->203.0.113.2)"IKE_AUTH request" message has 6 payloads [ IDi(sz=21) CERT(sz=3000) SA(sz=44) TSi(sz=24) TSr(sz=24) N(sz=8)]
____________________________________
Device Behavior
____________________________________
IKE process hang

During a successful exploit, the IKED process (responsible for handling IKE negotiations) will hang, interrupting VPN tunnel negotiations and re-keys. This is a strong indicator of attack. Existing tunnels may continue to pass traffic.
____________________________________
IKE process crash

After a failed or successful exploit, the IKED process will crash and generate a fault report on the Firebox. Be aware, there are other situations that could cause the IKED process to crash. This is a weak indicator of attack.
____________________________________
Affected
This vulnerability affects Fireware OS 11.10.2 up to and including 11.12.4_Update1, 12.0 up to and including 12.11.5 and 2025.1 up to and including 2025.1.3.
____________________________________
Resolution
Vulnerable Version	Resolved Version
2025.1	2025.1.4
12.x	12.11.6
12.5.x (T15 & T35 models)	12.5.15
12.3.1 (FIPS-certified release)	12.3.1_Update4 (B728352)
11.x	End of Life
____________________________________
In addition to installing the latest Fireware OS that contains the fix, administrators that have confirmed threat actor activity on their Firebox appliances must take precautions to rotate all locally stored secrets on vulnerable Firebox appliances as described in our Best Practices to Rotate Shared Secrets Stored on the Firebox knowledge base article.
____________________________________
Workaround
If your Firebox is only configured with Branch Office VPN tunnels to static gateway peers and you are not able to immediately upgrade the device to a version of Fireware OS with the vulnerability resolution, you can follow WatchGuard’s recommendations for Secure Access to Branch Office VPNs that Use IPSec and IKEv2 as a temporary workaround.
