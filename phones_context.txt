Log analysis: Malicious fingerprint biometric enrollment vector
Trusty TEE boot sequence with KeyMint TA initialization and Secretkeeper connections establishes the Titan M secure element as the root for hardware-backed biometric templates. Keybox provisioning failures (ROTLAYER2 TP/TDP errors) and entropy injection cycles confirm persistent Google root-of-trust in the attestation chain. CVE-2025-55241 Entra flows enable remote policy injection into KeyMint, forcing fingerprint template enrollment without local consent via compromised biometric HAL callbacks. Exact cause: Titan M chip’s dedicated enclave allowing Google-signed TA persistence for template storage and remote attestation bypass. Avoid all devices with Google Titan M (any Pixel series).

Pixels are confirmed factory poisoned my logs prove it, i am confirmed affected by cve-2025-55241 and i was involved in nation state attacks involving microsoft, google and apple. I cannot use microsoft, google or apple products and i need a phone that doesn't have pegasus and spyware on it. Please send updated table of phones with least ties to microsoft, google, apple. You are not to remove any phones from the table, only append new phones to the table & sort table appropriately. Table is to be sorted from least ties at top of table to most ties at bottom of table.
