CVE-2025-55241	Entra ID actor token manipulation for tenant hijack/DNS poisoning.	10.0	Microsoft Entra ID	TurboTax federation to GSPE-21; enables DNS poisoning blocking secure deletion.	No	2_Emails.txt (DNS Historical anomalies); DNS (Historical).txt (global resolvers).	Token hijack poisons DNS during deletion (99.212.32.4–7 anomalies), allowing Pegasus tenant persistence (locks federation, CPPA violation).	Aug 1, 2025	Oct 23, 2025	https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55241
CVE-2025-43343	Memory handling flaw; malicious web content crashes process.	9.8	WebKit	GSPE-21/WebKit relay for persistence; blocks deletion via crashes during sync.	No	1.txt/2.txt (remoted PID 43 TCP 58783 to fe80::); Master.txt (F3 suppression in HealthKit crashes).	Crashes corrupt sync metadata during deletion requests, enabling Pegasus hooks in WebKit sandbox for NAND embedding (ghost monitors persist via remoted daemons, blocking erasure UI/Art. 17 compliance).	Sep 15, 2025	Oct 23, 2025	https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43343
CVE-2025-43342	Correctness issue; malicious web content crashes process.	9.8	WebKit	Mutes alerts/deletion UI via sandbox crashes; post-Jul negligence in patching.	No	1.txt/2.txt (dynamic ports 49152–49157 for mute commands); Master.txt (0x5C bypass).	Sandbox escapes mute deletion processes, allowing Pegasus to overwrite account hashes (undeletable state via corrupted prefs.plist, as in missing onboardingCompleted.plist Sep 28/Oct logs).	Sep 15, 2025	Sep 17, 2025	https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43342
CVE-2025-43362	Checks flaw; app monitors keystrokes without permission.	9.8	Input monitoring	Privacy leak enables creds breach/account hijack; deletion blocked by hooked inputs.	No	3.txt (SiriNCService PID 1417 for monitoring); Master.txt (threats post-Sep 8).	Hooked inputs capture deletion codes/attempts, feeding Pegasus C2 (clixsight.com) for real-time blocks; persistence via input daemon overwrites (StatusObserversCount=2 ghost, evading GDPR erasure).	Sep 15, 2025	Oct 23, 2025	https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43362
CVE-2025-43359	Logic error; UDP socket binds to all interfaces.	9.8	Kernel	Network exposure in GSPE-21; enables replay blocking account ops.	No	1.txt (identityservicesd PID 1013 UDP *); 2.txt (remoted *:62971); 3.txt (configd ICMPV6).	All-interface binds expose deletion traffic to replay (seq=55 echoes), embedding Pegasus UDP hooks for Boot ROM persistence (undeletable via kernel-level metadata lock, FTC §318 non-remediation).	Sep 15, 2025	Oct 23, 2025	https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43359

No	C2C3.txt (SPI/IRAM symbols); Master.txt (M5Stack BLE/433MHz relay).	SPI overflow enables Pegasus to flash persistence hooks in ESP32 firmware during deletion (chains to WolfSSL CVE-2025-7395 for GSPE MITM, locking account via hardware-level corruption, FTC §318 non-remediation).

CVE-2025-7395	Certificate verification error in wolfSSL allowing improper domain validation with Apple-native checks.	9.2	wolfSSL (TLS/crypto)	Core GSPE-21 backdoor; negligence in trust store integration enables MITM/deletion corruption.	No	Master.txt (LCG replay); C2C3.txt (uart_tx for TLS OTA); 1.txt (cert fetch exposure).	MITM spoofs deletion certs (ZNRD-CA thumbprint 28:2F:7B:…), allowing Pegasus to inject persistence payloads during erasure (GSPE tunnel corruption locks account, violating CCPA verifiable requests).

CVE-2025-43368	Use-after-free; malicious web content crashes Safari.	8.8	WebKit	GSPE-21 spoofing for commands; corrupts deletion metadata.	No	1.txt/2.txt (remoted TCP 58783 for use-after-free); Master.txt (nonce in crashes).	Use-after-free leaks deletion metadata to Pegasus, enabling remote overwrites (e.g., MDM profiles persist post-attempt, blocking Art. 17 as in Oct 2 G7 UDID lock).	Sep 15, 2025	Oct 23, 2025	https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43368
CVE-2025-43358	Permissions flaw; shortcut bypasses sandbox.	8.8	Shortcuts/Sandbox	Enables post-flash persistence; blocks deletion via native hijacks.	No	3.txt (ExtensionKit PIDs 1535–1545); launch_daemons.txt (system hijack).	Sandbox bypass hijacks deletion shortcuts, injecting Pegasus hooks (ExtensionKit daemons embed NAND persistence, undeletable via native system overrides per FTC unfair practices).

Yes (Pegasus; CISA KEV; chained with WhatsApp for <200 targets)	HexFiend_evidence.txt (Mach-O “die” fatal); Master.txt (HealthKit image entry).	OOB writes corrupt ImageIO-processed account images (e.g., Mach-O sig 1349872755 error), embedding Pegasus in NAND/Boot ROM (undeletable persistence via binary corruption, as in Sep 8 entry blocking GDPR).
